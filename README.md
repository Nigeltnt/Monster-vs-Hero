#Monster-vs-Hero
This game is a simulation based on a player and enemy formally named Hero and Enemy.
Both players start with the same health of 10.
The hero rolls a dice and thus subtract from the Monster health and if the Monster health is greater than 0 then they get their turn to roll the dice and subtract health from the Hero.
This is done until either one of them have health of less or equal to 0.
This game is based on the do-while and while loops.
